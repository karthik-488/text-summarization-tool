"DESCRIPTION": A text summarization tool condenses long pieces of text into shorter, more readable versions while preserving key information. It leverages artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze, extract, and generate concise summaries.There are two primary types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization selects key sentences or phrases directly from the original text to form a summary, maintaining the exact wording. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, generates a new version of the summary by reinterpreting and paraphrasing the original content, often improving readability and coherence.Modern text summarization tools use machine learning models, such as deep learning-based transformers, to understand context, relevance, and linguistic patterns in text. These models analyze sentence importance and relationships to generate accurate summaries.Summarization tools are widely used in journalism, education, research, and business. They help users quickly grasp essential insights from reports, articles, and academic papers, improving efficiency in information retrieval and decision-making. By reducing reading time while maintaining accuracy, they enhance productivity for students, professionals, and anyone dealing with large volumes of textual data.
